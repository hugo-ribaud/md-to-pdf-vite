*Current RIPER Mode: RESEARCH*

## Current Focus
Project initialization has been completed successfully. All foundational components are in place including project structure, technology stack selection, architecture definition, and development environment setup. Ready to begin development phase with RIPER workflow.

## Recent Changes
- 2024-12-19: Project initialization completed through START phase
- 2024-12-19: Technology stack finalized (React, Express, Puppeteer, Bun, Shadcn/ui, Vercel)
- 2024-12-19: Complete project scaffold created with all configuration files
- 2024-12-19: Memory bank initialized with all core intelligence files

## Active Decisions
- **Technology Stack**: APPROVED - React + Vite, Express.js, Puppeteer, Bun, Shadcn/ui, Vercel deployment
- **Architecture Pattern**: APPROVED - Client-Server with Processing Pipeline (Markdown → HTML → PDF)
- **Development Approach**: APPROVED - Monorepo structure with separate client/server packages
- **Deployment Strategy**: APPROVED - Vercel serverless functions with automatic scaling

## Next Steps
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `bun install` to install all project dependencies
2. **Create Basic Components**: Set up initial React components and Express server structure
3. **Implement File Upload**: Create drag-and-drop file upload interface
4. **Build Markdown Parser**: Implement Markdown-it with extensions for GFM, code highlighting, math
5. **Integrate PDF Generation**: Set up Puppeteer for HTML-to-PDF conversion
6. **Test Core Functionality**: Verify end-to-end conversion pipeline works

## Current Challenges
- **Puppeteer Memory Management**: Need to implement proper browser instance pooling for production
- **File Size Limits**: Must implement both client and server-side validation for 10MB limit
- **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling throughout the conversion pipeline
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching strategies for frequently converted documents

## Implementation Progress
- [✓] **Project Requirements**: Documented in projectbrief.md
- [✓] **Technology Selection**: Completed and documented in techContext.md
- [✓] **System Architecture**: Defined in systemPatterns.md
- [✓] **Project Scaffold**: Complete folder structure and configuration files
- [✓] **Environment Setup**: All development tools configured
- [✓] **Memory Bank**: All intelligence files created and populated
- [ ] **Dependency Installation**: Ready to install with `bun install`
- [ ] **Basic Server Setup**: Express.js server with API endpoints
- [ ] **Frontend Components**: React components for file upload and conversion
- [ ] **Markdown Processing**: Markdown-it integration with extensions
- [ ] **PDF Generation**: Puppeteer integration for PDF output
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Complete conversion workflow testing
